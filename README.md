- [x] When clicking on notification popup does not always open notifi Mac app.
- [x] Links not clickable

- [x] For some reason after deleting notifications in the window if you follow the mouse around you can see the cursor for text and links and also if you right click it throws an error because of it thinking there is an object there. I believe this may have something todo with wantsLayer
- [x] time not updating automatically.
