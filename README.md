<p align="center"><b>Push notifications for scripts, servers, apps and devices.</b></p>

One HTTP request to `notifi.it` and it’s on your iPhone or Mac.

```bash
curl "https://notifi.it/send?key=nk_…&title=hello+world"
```

No accounts. No sign-in. No device linking. The device holds the only private key,
notification content is encrypted with that key at ingest so the server cannot read it, and
each notification is deleted once the device acknowledges it. It is a relay, not a
mailbox.

The backend is a single Cloudflare Worker over a D1 database; the app is a
zero-dependency SwiftUI client for iOS 17+ and macOS 14+.

```
