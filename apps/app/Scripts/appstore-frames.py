"""Compose the App Store screenshots from raw simulator captures.

Same type as the site — Recursive Mono for the title, Karla for the
description, one red accent — set on a soft ground with the whole device
floating on it: rounded, shadowed, a hairline ring standing in for the bezel,
and clear of every edge. Output is 1290x2796 (the 6.9" iPhone set), or
2048x2732 with IPAD=1 — both are required, because the app runs on iPad.

Normally not run by hand: `make screens` builds, captures both device
sets from the Simulator, and runs this twice (plain, then IPAD=1). To re-render
from existing captures:

    SHOTS=<dir> LOCALE=<locale> python3 apps/app/Scripts/appstore-frames.py

LOCALE names both the caption set in fastlane/screenshot-copy.json and the
output directory under fastlane/screenshots, and defaults to en-GB.

Run it from the repo root. The seeded feed points its one image at
notifi.it/demo/latency.png, so that has to be deployed for the graph to appear.
