# Every iOS screenshot the product publishes, from one command: the App Store
# sets (iPhone 6.9" and the mandatory iPad 12.9") into fastlane/screenshots,
# and four device shots into apps/api/public/screens.
#
#   make screens
#
# The captures drive nothing by touch. The app seeds its sample data and opens
# the sample message from launch environment (see shotSetup in
# InboxRootView.swift), so a capture is launch → settle → screenshot. Tapping
# was the flaky half of doing this by hand: a shot taken before a menu closed
# or a row settled looks like a bug in the thing being screenshotted.
#
# The Mac popover shot is `make screens-mac` — a separate command because it
# builds and drives the macOS app.
#
# The images the seeded notifications carry are fetched from notifi.it/demo,
# so a new one has to be deployed before it can appear in a capture. Until it
# is, NOTIFI_DEMO_BASE points the seed at another HTTPS origin that serves the
# same bytes — the pushed branch does:
#
#   NOTIFI_DEMO_BASE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notifi-it/notifi/<branch>/apps/api/public/demo make screens
